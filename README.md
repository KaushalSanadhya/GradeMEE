# GradeMEE

The proposed report presents GradeMEE!, a system for Automatic Essay Grading, whichbased on statistical techniques, computes a holistic score for written essays. For building thearchitecture of this system we have used state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing NeuralNetwork Architectures (pre-trained AlBERT, pre-trained Sentence-RoBERTa, etc) and tookinspiration from Li et al. to build the overall system. Our system obtains comparableresults from the current SOTA model in this domain.
